This project is based on the
[NCS Example Application](https://github.com/nrfconnect/ncs-example-application).

## Getting started

Before getting started, make sure you have a proper nRF Connect SDK development
environment. Follow the official
[Getting started guide](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/getting_started.html).

### Initialization

The first step is to initialize the workspace folder (`thingy91x-oob`) where the
`firmware` project and all nRF Connect SDK modules will be cloned. Run the
following command:

```shell
# initialize thingy91x-oob workspace
west init -m https://github.com/hello-nrfcloud/firmware --mr main thingy91x-oob

cd thingy91x-oob

# enable Bosch environmental sensor driver
west config manifest.group-filter +bsec

# update nRF Connect SDK modules
west update

# use sysbuild by default
west config build.sysbuild True
```

### Building and running

To build the application, run the following command:

```shell
west build -b thingy91x/nrf9151/ns app
```

When using an external debugger, you can flash using this command:

```shell
west flash --erase
```

### LED pattern

| LED effect     | Color      | Meaning                                      | Duration (seconds)                                  |
|----------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Blinking       | Yellow     | Device is (re-)connecting to the LTE network | NA                                                  |
| Blinking slow  | Blue       | Device is actively polling cloud             | 10 minutes after last config update or button press |
| Solid          | Configured | Device has received a LED configuration      | NA                                                  |
| Blinking rapid | Red        | Fatal error, the device will reboot          | NA                                                  |

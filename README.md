This project is based on the
[NCS Example Application](https://github.com/nrfconnect/ncs-example-application).

## Getting started

Before getting started, make sure you have a proper nRF Connect SDK development
environment. Follow the official
[Getting started guide](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/getting_started.html).

### Initialization

Before initializing start the toolchain environment:

```shell
nrfutil toolchain-manager launch --shell
```

The first step is to initialize the workspace folder (`hello-nrfcloud`) where the
`firmware` project and all nRF Connect SDK modules will be cloned. Run the
following command:

```shell
# initialize hello-nrfcloud workspace
west init -m https://github.com/hello-nrfcloud/firmware --mr main hello-nrfcloud

cd hello-nrfcloud

# enable Bosch environmental sensor driver
west config manifest.group-filter +bsec

# update nRF Connect SDK modules
west update

# use sysbuild by default
west config build.sysbuild True
```

### Building and running

First change folder:

```shell
cd project
```

To build the application, run the following command:

```shell
west build -b thingy91x/nrf9151/ns app
```

When using the serial bootloader, you can update using this command:

```
west thingy91x-dfu
```

When using an external debugger, you can flash using this command:

```shell
west flash --erase
```

Experimental: You can also use [pyOCD](https://github.com/pyocd/pyOCD) to flash the nRF9151 using the CMSIS-DAP interface provided by the Connectivity Bridge firmware.

Note: **Don't use pyOCD with JLink probes**, use [nrfutil-device](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/README.html) or the west runner in that case. pyOCD seems to be unmaintained at the moment, so this might not be fixed.

Another note: Sometimes, the nRF9151 is detected as protected and is mass-erased automatically. In that case, simply flash the bootloader as well.

To flash just the app:

```
pyocd flash build/app/zephyr/zephyr.signed.hex
```

To flash the bootloader (included in releases):

```
pyocd flash nrf91-bl-v2.hex
```

To erase the chip including UICR:

```
pyocd erase --mass
```

Experimental: You can update the modem firmware using pyOCD. A simple way to do this is to use the included `nrf91_flasher` script:

```
python3 scripts/nrf91_flasher.py -m mfw_nrf91x1_2.0.1.zip
```

| Blinking rapid | Red        | Fatal error, the device will reboot          | NA                                                  |
| Blinking slow  | Red        | Irrecoverable Fatal error                    | NA                                                  |

## Architecture

Documentation on the overall architecture of the firmware can be found in the document [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Troubleshooting

The following section contains guidelines on how to troubleshoot issues with the device.

### Modem Traces

Modem traces are enabled by default on the Thingy:91 X and continously stored to external flash. These traces can be output to UART for analysis using the **nRF Connect for Desktop Cellular Monitor** application.

#### Steps to Capture and Dump Modem Traces:

1. **Connect to a Serial Terminal**
   - Connect your Thingy:91 X to a serial terminal on **UART 0**. This will allow you to interact with the device's shell commands. You might need to push **Button 1** to wake the UART up.

2. **Set Up Cellular Monitor Application**
   - Open the [Cellular Monitor Application](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-connect-cellularmonitor/page/index.html).
   - Connect the Thingy:91 X to the application, select **UART 1** as the trace output, and click **Start Traces** to begin capturing modem activity.

3. **Dump Traces via UART**
   - Ensure that the error scenario has been captured. Note that older traces will be overwritten by new ones when the flash buffer is full, so ensure that the issue you want to troubleshoot has occured relatively recent to dumping of the traces over UART.
   - Use the following shell commands in the connected serial terminal to manage and dump the modem traces on **UART 1**:

   ```shell
   modem_trace stop         # Stop modem tracing if running
   modem_trace size         # Check the size of stored traces
   modem_trace dump_uart    # Dump traces to UART 1 for analysis
